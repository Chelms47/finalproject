Project for Code Louisville Front-End
This is supposed to be a very (very) basic blog for my friend Samantha.

The 3 custom CSS selectors/rules I created are 

      1.(.post) - This made a grid to display the different blog posts/topics by having a white background
      2.(.rightcol) - This helped seperate the content from the left column. I had a white background for the different sections.
      3.(.h2) - I added a background color to this to make the titles of these sections stand out
      
      
The JavaScript function I created was 

      a button for the user to subscribe to a newsletter-just a basic email input field once the user hits "ok" the site thanks them.
